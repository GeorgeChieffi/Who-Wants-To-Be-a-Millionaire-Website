        <h1>Welcome to 'Who Wants to be a Millionare'</h1>
        <p>
          Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? is a quiz competition where contestants
          have to correctly answer a series of multiple-choice questions in
          order to advance to the next question. There are 15 questions in total
          and each question is worth a specific amount of money and no time
          limit is placed on contestants to come up with an answer.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Each question is worth a specific amount of money; the amounts are not
          cumulative. If at any time the contestant gives a wrong answer, the
          game is over and the contestant's winnings are reduced to $0. However,
          the contestant may choose to walk away after being presented with a
          question, allowing them to keep all the money they have won to that
          point.
